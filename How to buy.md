9. After agreeing with all the listed terms and mutually decided price, please wait for the seller to approve the order and initiate the trade. The seller would also proceed to create the escrow transfer. 

Please be well noticed that the escrow transfer fees would be bore by the seller. Currently, all trades would have a flat 0.5 SBD fee for trades up to 100 STEEM/SBD, and 1.0 SBD fee for trades between 100-200 STEEM/SBD. SwapSteem, at the moment, is still in its alpha stage, hence a maximum cap of 200 STEEM/SBD is applied.

Wait for the seller to notify you when he/she has finished setting up the escrow transfer and provide you with the unique escrow id. 

After you have obtained the necessary information, approve the escrow using the steemconnect service through the hot sign functionality. You could access the service through this [link](https://steemconnect.com/sign) and select 'escrow approve'.

The page should display as follows,

For the 'Escrow Id' field,

11. The agent (@swapsteem) would have to approve the escrow as well after comfirming the transactions from both you and the seller.

Now, it's time for you to complete the payment. It should be done using the method specified. Pay the amount before the payment window is over. 

Do notify the seller after you have completed your transaction and mark the payment as done. Patiently wait for the seller to verify your payment and ultimately mark it done as well.

<br><hr> <br>

12. The whole process will be completed once the payment is verified by the seller, and the escrow will then release the STEEM or SBD instantly to your wallet through an escrow release protocol.
