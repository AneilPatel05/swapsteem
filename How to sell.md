<br><hr> <br>

Well, selling STEEM or SBD is particularly easy and pretty self-explanatory on SwapSteem. The whole process is faster yet safer thanks to the trustworthy escrow service provided.

Consider to visit our [ToS](https://github.com/nirvanaitsolutions/swapsteem/blob/master/ToS.md) if you are unsure with any specific terms or limitations bounded by the Agreement. By proceeding to use our service, you explicitly express agreement to such rules and you are fully aware of that.

1.Firstly, you should have logged in to our SwapSteem platform. Please refer to Step 1 to 3 of the 'Tutorial on How to Buy STEEM or SBD' to proceed.

<br><hr> <br>  

2.Welcome to SwapSteem!

You could first notice that your uppermost right corner has a 'logout' which indicates that you have successfully logged in. To sell some STEEM or SBD, simply hover your mouse to the uppermost row of the page and click on the 'Sell' button.

<br><hr> <br>  

3.The following page will be displayed on your screen.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zqqDxrb.png)

All the available buyers who have published advertisements to purchase STEEM or SBD will be shown here. The information listed will include the name of the buyer, the preferred payment methods, specified type of coins, prices and the desired limits. You could browse the list to look for any potential trade.

There are four blank spaces which you could observed on the page as well. The spaces allow you to specify your requirements which could effectively speed up the whole process. You could specify the 'Amount', 'Payment Currency', 'Location' and â€˜Payment Method' to your own desired values.

<br><hr> <br>  

4.Often, there would be a lot of buyers who would like to purchase the STEEM or SBD, hence it is foreseeable that choosing a potential buyer would be difficult. With that being said, you could select those with a good reputation score because that normally signifies the verifiability of the buyer.
 
At the same row with the buyer's name you could also see the 'Sell' button. Click on that if you agreed with the terms listed by that said buyer.

<br><hr> <br>  

5.After you have clicked on the 'Sell' button, you would then arrived at a page which has a lot more details regarding the advertisement, including the terms of the buyer. Before proceeding to the trade, it's a good practice to read through the terms of trade and understand the conditions wholly. If you don't agree with them, you could always return to the previous page and select another offer.

For this tutorial, we have chosen 'plokmi' as the buyer and we would like to sell some STEEM to him, which is also the last listing,

To initiate the trade, you should fill in the empty bars of 'coin' and 'fiat' to indicate how much you are willing to sell your cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies.

For the sake of making an example here, we would be offering to sell 1 STEEM for 100 USD,
![](https://i.imgur.com/BwXJPgP.png)

You could definitely use any amount at all which you deemed as reasonable pricing. Hover to the 'create order' button and click on it to proceed to the next step.

<br><hr> <br>

6.After a sell order has been successfully created, you would be redirected to the 'wallet' page for your account. The page will list all the current orders created by you. Just now, you have created a recent sell order on the buying advertisement made by one potential buyer. Therefore, to proceed, navigate to that order and click on the 'view' button.

And you will once again be brought to another page, which is similar to the following.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rGHXWls.png)

On the redirected page, you would notice there is a built in chat system which you could use. Simply drop your message and wait for the buyer to reply.

There are also other alternatives if you would like to communicate with the buyer. There is a SwapSteem community server in discord, which you could access [here](https://discord.gg/PngRxnz). Also, you could also use our dedicated chat server built on Rocket.Chat, which you could access [here](https://swapsteem.online/). In order to keep the conversation records verifiable especially in potential cases of disputes, do keep in mind that all conversations should be solely done on aforementioned platform only.

7.After you have read and decided to agree with the listed terms and mutually agreed price, you would then have to wait for the buyer to accept your order and initiate the trade. After the order is accepted, you would then have to create the escrow transfer.

Before we get started, you should be well informed that the escrow transfer fees would be bore by the escrow transfer creator, hence in this case, it's you. SwapSteem is currently in its alpha stage, thus, all trades would have a flat 0.5 SBD fee for trades up to 100 STEEM/SBD, and 1.0 SBD fee for trades between 100-200 STEEM/SBD. A maximum cap of 200 STEEM/SBD would be applied.

Now, when all necessary terms have been clarified and defined clearly, create the escrow transfer using the steemconnect service through the hot sign functionality. You could access the service through this [link](https://steemconnect.com/sign) and select 'escrow transfer'.

The following page would be displayed,

Scroll down the list of services offered and look for the 'escrow transfer' functionality.

8.The following page would be then displayed. An example page is being shown below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/phH82cA.png)

Please go through the page and fill in the blank spaces with the required details.

For the 'From' field, you should put in your own Steemit ID.

For the 'To' field, you should input the Steemit ID of the buyer.

For the 'Agent' field, select @swapsteem as the escrow agent. (At the current alpha stage, only @swapsteem could be chosen as the escrow agent. More options would be available at the later stage of this platform.)

For the 'Escrow Id' field, you could choose one unique ID for your escrow. The ID chosen must be an unique integer and shall not be duplicated during the creation of other escrows. For example, if you choose number '1' as your 'Escrow Id', the same value could not be use to create another escrow.

For the 'Sbd Amount' field, you should specify how many SBD you would like to send. (In this tutorial, since we are selling STEEM, this field would be set as '0 SBD')

For the 'Steem Amount' field, you should indicate how many STEEM you would like to transfer. (In this tutorial, since we are selling 1 STEEM only, this field would be set as '1 STEEM')

For the 'Fee' field, you should specify what is the amount of fee you would like to send to the agent. It can be either STEEM or SBD. (Under the current stage of SwapSteem, selling 1 STEEM would have a fee of 0.5 SBD, therefore, this field would be set as '0.5 SBD)

For the 'Ratification Deadline' field, the deadline of the escrow would be put in here. The format of the date should be in this pattern: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'. Please note that the date chosen must not be in the past! (For this tutorial, we set the date as '2018-08-28T00:00:00' to signify the date of 28th of August, 2018 at the time of 12:00:00a.m.)

For the 'Escrow Expiration' field, you should input the expiration date of the escrow. The same format applies here as well. However, this date should come later from the  date used in 'Ratification Deadline'. (For this tutorial, we set the date as '2018-08-28T12:00:00' to signify the date of 28th of August, 2018 at the time of 12:00:00p.m.)

Lastly, for the 'Json Meta' field, you could include some JSON data in your escrow transaction. Please use the format of JSON data. (We would be letting this field blank, by putting in '{}')

Click on 'Generate Link' once you have done.

Once again, click on 'try link' and a page similar to the following will be created.

Continue until the operation is being successfully broadcasted on the blockchain.

<br><hr> <br>

9.After you have successfully created the escrow transfer. Notify the buyer and provide the buyer with the unique escrow Id. Now, wait for the buyer to complete the escrow approve.

Then, the agent (@swapsteem) would have to approve the escrow as well after comfirming the transactions from both you and the seller.

The agent would also notify you again, once the approval is made. Use some patience to allow the buyer to complete the payment within the agreed payment window, using the specified payment method. Wait for the buyer to mark the payment as done.

You would then, have to check the payment and only verify the payment after you have truly received the payment. 

<br><hr> <br>

10.As a seller, this would be the last step in the whole selling process. Now, you would have to release the escrow.

Kindly go to steemconnect hot sign again [here](https://steemconnect.com/sign) and select 'escrow release'.

By broadcasting this operation, the process is deemed complete, permanent and would be irreversible. Never ever confirm a trade if you have not yet received the payment because there is no way for us, the escrow, to get back the STEEM or SBD.

And, congratulations! You have successfully sold your STEEM or SBD!
