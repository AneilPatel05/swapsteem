[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7767d6e17e9e49d4823b7952ed961712)](https://app.codacy.com/app/nirvanaitsolutions/swapsteem?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nirvanaitsolutions/swapsteem&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)
SwapSteem is a peer-to-peer, no custodian exchange platform built on the Steem blockchain. The main vision behind Swapsteem is to create a platform to enable Steem users to trade their STEEM/SBD for Fiat, Cryptocurrencies tokens, or pretty much anything with other users. It is a completely open source software licensed under AGPL and the license and source code can found on our github repo.
We have installed a dynamic system on the SwapSteem UI, where trading parties signal each other for instant trading, and we connect the trading parties together to relate their terms and conditions of trade,and upon agreement a trade is initiated between the users. For each trade a trusted escrow agent is assigned for the cases when a dispute arises between the parties involved in the trade.
