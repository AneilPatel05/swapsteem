# Terms of Service

<hr>

## Welcome to SwapSteem

SwapSteem is a peer-to-peer platform which the service is dedicated to facilitate the conversion of STEEM or SBD to different fiat currencies. The platform service aims to cater the strong need for peer-to-peer exchange elevated by the escalating growth of user base on STEEM  blockchain adoption, and ease the process by providing with secure escrow transactions in moderation of various influential STEEM escrow agents for their respective country, or currency. 

Like any peer-to-peer platform, the users are able to create advertisements to offer a desired price to trade STEEM or SBD to fiat currencies or vice versa. Interested users will reply to the advertisements and the trade could be done face-to-face or online based on the agreement agreed by both parties. A user who sells STEEM or SBD (hereinafter referred to as "seller") will first have to deposit an amount of STEEM or SBD in the SwapSteem online wallet, which is linked to their own account. A user who is interested to buy STEEM or SBD ("buyer") will then have to pay the agreed amount of fiat currencies to the seller. The STEEM or SBD will then be transferred once the payment from the buyer is being verified, completing the whole process of the service. As an escrow service provider, SwapSteem is not participating in any STEEM or SBD trade or transactions conducted by its users. The trades on the sites are essentially conducted by the users of the service themselves.

ID verified accounts can provide clear identification of ownership, which is helpful in any unfortunate events including losing all access to your account or in any cases of disputes. Unverified accounts would be having difficulties to regain access to, simply because it is extremely hard to verify the true ownership.

## Trading and Advertisements

A registered account is entitled to create STEEM or SBD trade advertisements ("advertisement" or "ad" or "ads") to indicate and broadcast that you are interested in buying or selling STEEM or SBD. STEEM or SBD trades ("trade" or "contract") can be initiated by contacting advertisements which are available on the platform, created by other users or wait for the users to contact the ads created by yourself. 

By initiating a STEEM or SBD or sending a trade request, you explicitly agree to be bound by the advertisers' terms of trade ("advertisersâ€™ terms") set forth by the advertiser which are displayed clearly on the advertisement page at SwapSteem. Please be advised that the terms and conditions determined by the advertiser are deemed valid in all cases except when there are clear contradiction or violation of the terms listed in this Agreement or are illegal or if both parties of the trade consent to alter the terms and conditions of the trade.

The price or exchange rate or price equation must explicitly contain any and all fees that the advertiser predefined the buyer initiating the trade to pay. All relevant details, including amount, payment window, payment method and other significant terms of conditions of a specified trade must be clearly shown on the advertisement page.

If you are a seller, you should verify that all information and details published by yourself regarding a trade are correct. After a trade is being initiated and the said buyer has made their payment, you must wholly confirm that, you have received full amount of the payment, the payment is made by the seller himself/ herself and not by a third party to the trade, and all instructions given by you are followed. It is impossible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise to recover or return STEEM or SBD to you once you have released a trade to the buyer.

There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.

## Disputes with Trades

Other conditions of trades, including not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the seller, cancelled by the buyer, automatically cancelled, or in the process of dispute resolution and resolved are considered completed and are impossible to be disputed, reversed or altered.

It is important for both the buyer and the seller to remain active and available right from the moment the trade is initiated to the moment the trade is completely fulfilled and completed. In cases of a disputed trade, you might be requested by SwapSteem support staff to provide a response within 12 hours or you may be deemed as unresponsive. If the buyer is unresponsive, the dispute will be resolved to the buyer if we are confident that the seller has received valid payment from the buyer, and vice versa.

## Supports for Blockchain Forks and Smart Media Token (SMT)

For STEEM blockchain, forks are always exciting and they bring new yet innovative updates to the blockchain itself. And the most exciting part for STEEM blockchain is that Smart Media Token ("SMT") is coming and this may result in holders of private keys containing a STEEM balance receiving a corresponding amount of new token on the newly created blockchain. SwapSteem reserve the right at our sole discretion to decide if and how we would offer support for any new cryptocurrencies and/ or blockchain forks in our services. If in cases which we decided not to support a new cryptocurrency, we may, but are not obligated to, compensate users who held STEEM in their SwapSteem online wallet at the time or air-drop.
