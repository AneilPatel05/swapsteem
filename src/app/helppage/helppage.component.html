    <h3>SWAPSTEEM – FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

    <hr>
    <h4>What is Swapsteem?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Swapsteem is a peer-to-peer exchange of STEEM/SBD between users (called traders) in the steem blockchain. We’re a fast,
      secure and convenient marketplace where traders create advertisements with the price and the payment method they want
      to offer. You can choose the user you want to trade (buy and/or sell) your STEEM/SBD with. You can also search for
      the amount, currency, country, and payment method of your preference.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How am I protected from being scammed?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Once you choose to make a trade, an escrow is initiated. Escrow places the seller’s money under our (@swapsteem) care
      in order to protect both buyer and seller in a transaction. When both parties verify the transaction has been completed
      per terms set, the money is released. If at any point a dispute arises between the parties in the transaction, we will
      reimburse the affected person. The outcome of the dispute resolution process will decide what happens to the money
      in escrow. **Please be sure you have received your money before you release them.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who manages my transactions?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">
      All transactions are managed by our escrow agents. Also, the escrow agents pay a certain deposit to us in order to become
      our trusted agent. We ‘Power up’ with these deposits and also refund the affected party, in any fraud cases. Also,
      should in case our agent turns out to favor any of the party, we immediately ban him from the role.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How long will my transaction take?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Typically, a Steem transaction validates within its three (3) seconds of initiation, you can view the status at http://steemd.com/@username.
      It may take up to a minute before your transaction will appear on our website. Kindly report to us if your transaction
      does not reflect in more than three (3) minutes later.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Is there a need to deposit STEEM/SBD before making a trade?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">There is no need to deposit STEEM/SBD before making a trade, instead you create escrow transactions.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who manages my dispute?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Disputes are managed by our qualified moderators in escrow, they have the power to return the amount to the buyer or
      seller, or split the amount as the case may be. Moderators also check for proof of payments in chat windows and take
      necessary decisions accordingly.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Can the rate change during the transaction?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Once an order is created, rate change is irreversible. For creating an ad, we take a margin from Creator (a percentage
      of the current market rate). If a user selects the ‘+0%’ margin, this means he wants to buy or sell at the current
      market rate. If he chooses the ‘-1%’ margin, his rate is 1% less than the market rate. Similarly, if the margin is
      +1%, his rate is 1% more than the market rate. Note that at the time of creating an order, it is created at market
      rate +/- margin. For instance, you created an ad at $1 per STEEM with 0% margin. If the market price rises, it will
      become the market price +0 % margin. The margin is the deciding factor. Rate always depends on the current price (+/-
      margin) set by Creator.</p>
    <h4>What is the transaction fee?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">@swapsteem charges a minimum fee of 1SBD. Fees may vary from different agents as they may choose their own fee.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How do I cancel my transaction?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Orders can be cancelled any time before an escrow is initiated. Users will be provided with Cancel Order button until
      the transaction status is escrow transferred. If an escrow has been initiated, the order can be automatically cancelled
      once it is not yet approved by the receiver and our agent.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why is my transaction still waiting for payment if I’ve already paid?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">You need to notify the seller after making the payment by uploading a proof of your payment and clicking the Mark Payment
      Done button.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What will happen if I close the browser tab?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Your session will be stored, but any unsubmitted data from your last session will be lost.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Sent funds to the wrong address. Can I recover my funds?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Trades on Swapsteem happen with other verified Steem users, each trade has a single registered owner that is irreversible.
      It is impossible to send funds to an unwanted address other than the advertisement owner, until and unless a user modifies
      the transaction URL. Kindly note that any modified transaction will not be approved and we will not, for no reason
      whatsoever; claim any responsibility for funds lost due to this.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>I have lost my username, password and the email I used to register with swapsteem. How can I retrieve my account?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Swapsteem does not require any additional account other than your Steem account. Kindly use the account recovery option
      provided at steemit.com if you want to recover your account.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Does swapsteem have some sort of feedback system?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Yes, there will be a feedback system. After each trade, both parties will give a feedback of each other’s experience.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the minimum of STEEM/SBD I can transact in swapsteem?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Every advertisement has to declare the minimum and maximum limit of order they take. Limits section is for that purpose
      only.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>What would be the format of the feedback?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Trustworthy This increases the receiver’s feedback score and also marks the receiver as a trusted person.
      <br>
      <strong>Positive</strong> This also increases the receiver’s feedback score.
      <br>
      <strong>Neutral</strong> This doesn’t affect the receiver’s feedback score.
      <br>
      <strong>Negative</strong> This affects the receiver’s feedback score.
      <br>
      <strong>Fraud</strong> This will affect the receiver’s feedback score drastically and also marks the person as a fraud.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>I’ve paid the seller but I haven’t received my STEEM/SBD/money yet. Is this normal?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">After making payments, you need to mark your payment as done so as to notify the seller. The seller checks his account
      for payment receipt and releases the money. If the seller is taking longer than the specified time to release payment,
      you can raise a dispute with proof of payment.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>I’ve made my payment, but I forgot to press the I have paid button or I did not press it in time</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">You need to make payments and mark them within the specified time. After time expiration, the order cancels automatically.
      You may lose your funds if you pay for a closed order.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Can I perform more than one transaction in swapsteem?</h4>
    <br>
    <p class="help-paragraph">Yes, users can make unlimited transactions, but the limit for free open trades is two (2) for a single trader.</p>
